# CardsXML-JQuery
Using AJAX to display cards from the anime: Naruto. 
Already done, this project was created to improve my abilities in JS, especially JQuery.
The main objective was to develop a code where I'd use a XML file to insert some data into the html page, imported by AJAX.
It's a small project, but in the end, i think I get to the point
